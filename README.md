## This is a random sentence maker machine.

**Press** the button to see it work!

## What is the purpose of this?

This is a project to advance my programming capabilities in Javascript.
The aim was to write code that would make a **random** sentence using multiple arrays of grouped word types.

It incorporates Javascript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

## The main Javascript concepts:

- Arrays
- Maths methods such as `Maths.floor()` and `Maths.random()`
- Functions

## The main HTML and CSS uses:

- styling
- positioning

## Bootstrap was used for:

- responsive design
- special icons
